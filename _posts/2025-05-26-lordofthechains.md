# About the Project
This eight-week project provides a structured introduction to Web3 focusing on blockchain, covering topics from fundamentals to real-world applications. Participants will engage in theoretical learning and hands-on development, culminating in the creation of a fully functional decentralized application(DApp).

# Resources
## üóìÔ∏è Week 1: Intro to Web3 and Blockchain

### üåê What is Web3? The Concept of Decentralization

- [What is Web3? (FreeCodeCamp)](https://www.freecodecamp.org/news/what-is-web3/)  
  _We recommend that you read this before attending. It gives a basic understanding of Web3._

- [The Web3 Reading List (PDF)](https://d1lamhf6l6yk6d.cloudfront.net/uploads/2021/10/The-web3-Readlng-List.pdf)  
  _A slightly longer PDF covering a wide range of topics like Web3 applications, DAOs, DeFi, and Dapps. (Optional for now, will look into applications soon)_

- [Web3 vs Web 3.0 (LeewayHertz)](https://www.leewayhertz.com/web3-vs-web3-0/)  
  _Clarifies the distinction between Web3 and Web 3.0._

- [Why Decentralization Matters (cdixon.org)](https://cdixon.org/2018/02/18/why-decentralization-matters)  
  _We suggest reading this at the end of Week 1. Gives a gist of the possibilities decentralizations opens up._

### üîê Public and Private Key Cryptography 
Basic cryptography concepts to understand how identity verification methods like passwords can be eliminated.
- [Asymmetric and Symmetric Encryption (YouTube)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o_g-M7UBqI8)
- [Private and Public Key Cryptography (YouTube)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_zyKvPvh808)
- [Hashing and Hashing Algorithms (YouTube)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HHQ2QP_upGM)

### ‚õìÔ∏è Blockchain, Bitcoin, and Ethereum

- [What is a Blockchain? (YouTube)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SSo_EIwHSd4)
- [Bitcoin Whitepaper (PDF)](https://bitcoin.org/bitcoin.pdf)  
  _Gives more insight into PoW consensus._
- [What is Ethereum?](https://ethereum.org/en/what-is-ethereum/)  
  _Very important as we will be working on ethereum testnets primarily for our DApp._
- [Types of Blockchain (GeeksforGeeks)](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/types-of-blockchain/)

### ‚öñÔ∏è Consensus Mechanisms: PoW and PoS

- [What is Proof of Work? (Binance Academy)](https://academy.binance.com/en/articles/proof-of-work-explained)
- [What is Proof of Stake? (Ethereum.org)](https://ethereum.org/en/developers/docs/consensus-mechanisms/pos/)
