# About the Project
Implementing a rudimentary database to instill the idea of the inner working of a database.
We try to answer what are Low level functions of a system, how data is stored, retrieved, how sql works and a lot more.
1. Build a Strong Foundation: Cover essential database internals, including C programming, file systems, B-Trees, and process management.
2. Develop a rudimentary database with indexing, storage, and basic ACID properties while exploring SQL parsing and query execution.

## Week 0

### Session 1
1. Git- [Learn git branching](https://learngitbranching.js.org/)
It is recommended to do till Level 2 of "Moving work" round in **Main**
And till level 5 of "To Origin and Beyond" in **Remote**
2. File I/O- [File I/O in C](https://www.tutorialspoint.com/cprogramming/c_file_io.htm) - A pretty nice tutorial for file I/O in C, Mentors are recommended to follow through with the examples and then proceed with the problem statement given below to practice. 
3. Problem link- https://hackmd.io/@dOr-w0B8QXCdXE2gmetHYQ/Skxg7N8Wgg

### Session 2

## Week 1

### Session 1
1. B Trees-  https://planetscale.com/blog/btrees-and-database-indexes This website has an interactive interface for insertion and deletion in B-Trees. Pretty helpful for visualisation. Some more reading material- [Supplementary Stuff](https://www.cs.cornell.edu/courses/cs3110/2012sp/recitations/rec25-B-trees/rec25.html?source=post_page-----dcd77f5e995e---------------------------------------)
