summary:
- This seven-week project offers a deep dive into machine learning (ML) with a focus on audio applications. Starting with foundational ML concepts, it progresses to audio-specific techniques like denoising, super-resolution, and style transfer. Combining theory with hands-on practice, participants will learn to tackle real-world audio challenges using ML.

# About the Project
Implementing a rudimentary database to instill the idea of the inner working of a database.
We try to answer what are Low level functions of a system, how data is stored, retrieved, how sql works and a lot more.
1. Build a Strong Foundation: Cover essential database internals, including C programming, file systems, B-Trees, and process management.
2. Develop a rudimentary database with indexing, storage, and basic ACID properties while exploring SQL parsing and query execution.
