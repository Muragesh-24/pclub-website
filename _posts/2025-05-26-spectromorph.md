# About the Project
This seven-week project offers a deep dive into machine learning (ML) with a focus on audio applications. Starting with foundational ML concepts, it progresses to audio-specific techniques like denoising, super-resolution, and style transfer. Combining theory with hands-on practice, participants will learn to tackle real-world audio challenges using ML.
